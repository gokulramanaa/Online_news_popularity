# Neural Network for binary classification with PCA (Principle Component Analysis)

Trained a neural network to classify a particular news less popular or more popular. 

if the number of shares less than 1400 its less popular else more popular. 

This code shows creating the Neural network with 3 layers also implementation of Principle component analysis.

# Principle Component Analysis:

From the data set of 40000 observations 60 attributes, by implementing the PCA algorithm dimension is reduced to 45 attributes with 9$% variance recovered. 


## Training set gives the 66% accuracy, since the number of shares of news are not only based on mentioned attributes, it may vary depends upon various other current situation and trends. However, my model gives the 65% accuracy on testing data
